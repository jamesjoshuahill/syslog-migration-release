A simple test runner. In case of failure, deployment resources are not deleted.

    ./tests/execute

    # or for just one suite of tests
    ./tests/execute defaults

The [`manifest.yml`](manifest.yml) is the base deployment manifest with a single storer and single forwarder. Individual test suites must have a `manifest-ops.yml` file in their directory which may further manipulate the base manifest. A fresh deployment is created for each suite, and then the `test-*` files are executed against it.


# Setup

To run, ensure you have [bosh-cli](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html) installed and configured the environment with...

 * **`BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`** - the environment for test deployments (you must already be logged in)
 * `BOSH_GW_HOST`, `BOSH_GW_USER`, `BOSH_GW_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH gateway details (if necessary)

And that a cloud-config is configured with...

 * VM Type `default`
 * Network `default`
 * Availability Zone `z1`

And a stemcell is uploaded.


## bosh-lite

If you're using bosh-lite...

    $ bosh upload-stemcell \
      --sha1=7e8d841c5f4d736285ce21a1d582a645c2830cbf \
      https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3363.9
    $ bosh update-cloud-config <( wget -qO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/master/warden/cloud-config.yml )

## ginkgo tests
The above describe the tests original to this branch.
In addition, there are tests using ginkgo,
which have been backported.

To run these tests,
you'll need to setup a bosh-lite and login to it.
If you don't have a bosh-lite running
and aliased as `vbox` already:
```sh
./tests/scripts/setup-bosh-lite-for-tests.sh
```

If you don't already have BOSH credential
environment variables in your session:
```
./tests/scripts/export-bosh-lite-creds.sh
```

To then run the tests locally:
```sh
BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=vbox ./tests/scripts/gtest
```
